          " Joe Eckstein was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1995. Joe’s childhood consisted of fishing, friends, hunting, being outdoors and all the pleasantries that come with living in the midwest, but he was morbidly fascinated with the dark undertones of society that contradicted his world.",
          "As a film-obsessed freshman at the University of Missouri, Joe honed his storytelling abilities through journalism and film-intensive courseloads. Upon graduation, he worked as an editor/project coordinator on a Star Trek docu-series before giving Missouri a valedictory wave and moving to Los Angeles. While living in South Central with fifteen other people, Joe committed two years learning the technical craft of special effects for the house that handled Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, Forrest Gump, and Pirates of the Caribbean.",
          "When the pandemic hit, Joe refused to sit still, spending his freetime producing a crowdfunded short project titled Honeymoon Missouri and writing a feature epic that placed in the second round of the Austin Film Festival's 2021 Screenplay Competition, besting over 15,000 other submissions. He also proceeded to work in the special effects departments for Searchlight's Quasi, Paramount's The Offer, Hulu's How I Met Your Father, and HBO's Euphoria. He can tell you right here right now that Lexi's play was not something that could have been accomplished by high schoolers.",
          'Joe is inspired by danger, the great outdoors, and Kendrick Lamar. He wants to tell stories that validate the presence of bravery in humankind and may someday be in the "forbidden" section of dystopian libraries. Stories that humanity may be more comfortable keeping in the dark, yet stories that are undeniably real.',
          "He intends to have more fun than should be legal in the process.",

Before then, he has done music videos, commercials, and worked as a second unit DP on a widely released feature film, Rollers (2020). Solely focused on the story, Brandan’s work offers a wide range of techniques, lenses, and exposures. His work can be noticed by the attention to the frame.",
